    "# Difference between parquet , avro and ORC file formats supported by pyspark.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parquet:\n",
    "# Parquet is a columnar storage format developed by the Apache Software Foundation for use in the Hadoop ecosystem.\n",
    "# It is optimized for query performance and efficient storage of data.\n",
    "# Parquet stores data in a columnar format, meaning that values from the same column are stored together, allowing for better compression (\"snappy\", \"gzip\", \"lzo\", \"brotli\", or \"zstd\") and faster query processing, especially when dealing with selective column projections.\n",
    "# It supports nested data structures, making it suitable for handling complex data types like arrays and structs.\n",
    "# Parquet files are splittable, meaning they can be read in parallel, which is crucial for distributed processing frameworks like Apache Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exaple to save DataFrame to Parquet with Snappy compression:\n",
    "# df.write.parquet(\"/path/to/save/location\", compression=\"snappy\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Avro:\n",
    "# Avro is a row-based data serialization system developed within the Apache Hadoop project.\n",
    "# It is designed to be compact, fast, and suitable for both serialization and data exchange between systems.\n",
    "# Avro supports schema evolution, meaning that you can change the schema of your data without needing to modify the entire dataset.\n",
    "# Avro supports rich data structures, including nested records and complex types like arrays and maps.\n",
    "# It provides features like data compression ( \"snappy\", \"gzip\", \"deflate\", \"bzip2\", or \"zstandard\") and schema resolution, making it efficient for use cases like data serialization and data exchange between different systems.\n",
    "# Avro is self-describing, meaning that the schema is stored along with the data, making it easier to read and process without prior knowledge of the schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example to save DataFrame to Avro with Snappy compression:\n",
    "# df.write.format(\"avro\").option(\"compression\", \"snappy\").save(\"/path/to/save/location\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# ORC (Optimized Row Columnar):\n",
    "# ORC is a columnar storage format developed for use in the Apache Hive data warehouse system.\n",
    "# It is optimized for both read and write performance, especially in the context of analytics and data warehousing workloads.\n",
    "# ORC provides features like predicate pushdown and column projections, allowing for efficient query processing by reading only the necessary columns and rows.\n",
    "# Similar to Parquet, ORC files are splittable and support compression (\"snappy\", \"zlib\", \"lzo\", \"lz4\", or \"zstd\"), making them suitable for use in distributed processing frameworks like Apache Spark.\n",
    "# ORC also supports schema evolution, enabling you to evolve your data schema over time without requiring a full data rewrite.\n",

    "#  .getOrCreate()\n",
    "\n",
    "# spark.stop()\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔹Data Serialization:\n",
    "# Choose efficient serialization: Use a more efficient serialization format like Avro or Parquet, which can reduce the amount of data transfer and storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "# spark.conf.set(\"spark.serializer\", \"org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer\")\n",
    "# spark.conf.set(\"spark.kryo.registrator\", \"your.package.YourKryoRegistrator\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔹Data Partitioning:\n",
    "# Optimize data partitioning: Repartition your data using repartition or coalesce to balance data distribution and avoid data skew.\n",
    "\n",
    "# df = df.repartition(100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔹Caching and Persistence:\n",
    "# Cache and persist data: Use cache() or persist() to store frequently used data in memory for faster access.\n",
    "\n",
    "# df = df.cache()\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔹Shuffling Optimization:\n",
    "# Minimize shuffling: Avoid unnecessary shuffling by using operations like reduceByKey instead of groupByKey.\n",
    "\n",
    "# rdd.reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔹Broadcasting:\n",

    "# Apache Spark has a distributed and modular internal architecture that allows it to efficiently process large volumes of data. Below, I'll provide an overview of Spark's internal architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Driver Program:**\n",
    "#  - The Driver Program is the entry point of any Spark application. It runs the `main()` function and creates a SparkSession or SparkContext, which is used to coordinate the execution of Spark tasks.\n",
    "#  - The Driver Program is responsible for dividing the application into tasks, scheduling these tasks on the cluster, and managing their execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Cluster Manager:**\n",
    "#  - Spark can run on various cluster managers, including Apache Hadoop YARN, Apache Mesos, and its standalone cluster manager.\n",
    "#  - The cluster manager allocates resources (CPU and memory) to Spark applications and monitors their progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Cluster Nodes (Executors):**\n",
    "#  - Executors are worker nodes in the Spark cluster where the actual computation takes place.\n",
    "#  - Each executor runs tasks in separate JVM processes. Executors communicate with the Driver Program and with each other for data shuffling and task coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Task:**\n",
    "#  - A task is the smallest unit of work in Spark and represents a computation to be executed on a single partition of data.\n",
    "#  - Tasks are spawned by the Driver Program and run on the Executors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Distributed Data Storage:**\n",
    "#  - Spark can use distributed data storage systems like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Apache HBase to store and access data.\n",
    "#  - Data is divided into partitions and distributed across the cluster, enabling parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. **Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD):**\n",
    "#  - RDD is Spark's fundamental data structure. It represents distributed collections of data that can be processed in parallel.\n",
    "#  - RDDs are immutable and fault-tolerant, meaning they can recover from node failures by recomputing lost data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):**\n",
    "#  - Spark uses a DAG to represent a logical execution plan of tasks and transformations.\n",
    "#  - Each stage in the DAG corresponds to a set of transformations that can be executed in parallel.\n",
    "#  - The DAG scheduler optimizes the execution plan and schedules tasks based on data dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. **Transformations and Actions:**\n",
    "#  - Transformations are operations applied to RDDs to create new RDDs (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduceByKey`).\n",
    "#  - Actions are operations that trigger the execution of transformations and return results (e.g., `collect`, `count`, `saveAsTextFile`).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. **Shuffling:**\n",
    "#  - Shuffling is the process of redistributing data across partitions or nodes in the cluster.\n",
    "#  - It's a costly operation and can impact performance, so minimizing shuffling is important for Spark optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. **Caching:**\n",
    "#  - Spark allows you to cache (persist) RDDs or DataFrames in memory, improving performance for iterative algorithms and interactive data analysis.\n",

    "# Cluster \n",
    "# ======\n",
    "# A Cluster is a group of JVMs (nodes) connected by the network, each of which runs Spark, either in Driver or Worker roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Driver\n",
    "# ======\n",
    "# The Driver is one of the nodes in the Cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The driver does not run computations (filter, map, reduce, etc).\n",
    "# It plays the role of a master node in the Spark cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When you call collect() on an RDD or Dataset, the whole data is sent to the Driver. This is why you should be careful when calling collect().\n",
    "\n",
    "# Executor\n",
    "# ========\n",
    "# Executors are JVMs that run on Worker nodes. These are the JVMs that actually run Tasks on data Partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Application\n",
    "# =========\n",
    "# An application comprises of several jobs. A job is created, whenever you execute an action function like write().\n",
    "\n",
    "# Job\n",
    "# ====\n",
    "# A job comprises of several stages. When Spark encounters a function that requires a shuffle it creates a new stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Transformation functions like reduceByKey(), Join() etc will trigger a shuffle and will result in a new stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Stage\n",
    "# =====\n",
    "# A stage comprises of several tasks and every task in the stage executes the same set of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Task\n",
    "# =====\n",
    "# Task is the smallest execution unit in Spark. It is a single operation applied to single partition.\n",
    " \n",
    "# Tasks are executed inside an executor. \n",
    "\n",
    "# A Spark application can have many jobs. \n",
    "# A job can have many stages. \n",
    "# A stage can have many tasks. \n",
    "# A task executes a series of instructions.\n"
